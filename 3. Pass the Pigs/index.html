      <p>
        The game of Pig is a very simple jeopardy dice game in which two players
        race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die
        until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the
        rolls (i.e. the turn total). <br /><br />At any time during a player's
        turn, the player is faced with two decisions: <br /><br /><strong
          >Roll</strong
        ><br />
        If the player rolls a - <br />1: The player scores nothing and it
        becomes the opponent's turn.<br />
        2 - 6: The number is added to the player's turn total and the player's
        turn continues.<br /><br /><strong>Hold</strong><br />The turn total is
        added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.
